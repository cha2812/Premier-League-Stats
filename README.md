# Premier-League-Stats
Explaining and providing insight into some statistics about the Premier League which is the Top Football league in England, the best football league in Europe and some clubs in South America.

## Introduction
This task of data analysis was done using an Excel spreadsheet. In this analysis, Pivot Tables were used to analyze statistics of players in the English Premier League which is the top professional football league in England for the 2022/2023 season. The data provided was complete and can be seen in the file called **Premier league stats.csv**.

## Problem Statement
To solve and provide solutions to the following problems and questions.
1. What players have the top 5 total stats in the season?
2. Which club has the youngest squad based on the average age of players?
3. What is the nationality breakdown of players in the Premier League?
4. What is the overall rating distribution of players from Arsenal in the database?
5. What is the average height and weight of players playing in Machester in the Premier League?
6. What 10 teams in the league pay the highest salaries?

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Processing
2. Use of Sum Function
3. Use of Count Function
4. Use of Average Function
5. Pivot Table
7. Data Visualization

## Data Analysis
The data provided was complete and can be seen in the file called **Premier league stats.csv**. As the data provided was complete, it made it easier for me to carry out my analysis. The data was a very large dataset with                                         
Columns = 90                                                                                                                      
Rows = 696
After this, I then used Pivot Table to solve and answer the medical questions and problems.

To create a Pivot table, 
- We select the whole table
- Then click on the Insert Tab
- Select Pivot Table
- Choose a new worksheet
- Then, it takes you to a new worksheet.



1. For the players who had the top 5 total stats in the season, drag the Full name into Rows and then drag the total stats into Values. Then filter to get the top 5 players with the highest stats.

2. For the club with the youngest squad based on the average age of players, you drag the clubs into Rows and then drag the Age into Values. To get the average, right-click on all the columns and change the aggregation from sum to average.

3. To find out the nationality breakdown of players in the Premier League in terms of percentage, you drag the nationality into Rows and then drag the nationality into Values. To get the count, right-click on all the columns and change the aggregation from sum to count.

## Conclusion
This is my fourth data analysis task using data to tell a story. Carrying out this analysis was made so easy with the use of the Pivot Table. As long as you know which field name to put into the Filters, Columns, Rows and Values and you put them into the section.
